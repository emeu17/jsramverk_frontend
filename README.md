# Jsramverk

This project was created during the course Jsramver, autum 2021

## Kmom01

Created a basic react app containing a Trix editor.

## Kmom02

Now possible to create new documents or update existing documents.

Added router and routes for first page, editor and list of all documents. Connected the frontend react-application to my backend express-API, which in turn is connected to a MongoDB. See my other github repository ***Javascript-backend*** for the API code.
